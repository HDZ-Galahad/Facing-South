### Hi there üëã
Glad you found your way to my repository. I'm Paul and I'm happy to be working as the leading software architect in Cologne. We use various tools like C#, Python, JavaScript, PhP and PL/SQL. Personally, I think Python is the strongest all-round tool here. During the day we try to create bug-free applications and maintain them, but at night I try to develop my own pixel-art games from time to time.

I'm always happy when someone asks me for my collaboration for their open-source project, but I'm also just as grateful every time people participate in my projects.

Kind regards,
<br><br>
Paul ‚úåÔ∏è
