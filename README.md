### Hi there 👋
I'm Paul and a passionate software developer. Professionally I work in Cologne with various development languages like Python, C#, JavaScript, PhP and PL/SQL and more. During the day I work on implementing artificial intelligence and interfaces for various industries and in the evenings I dabble in pixel-art game development as a hobby.

I am always happy to participate in open source projects, but also if someone wants to contribute ideas to my projects. If you want to contact me, you can write me a mail:

paulwenzlaff@gmail.com

Kind regards,
<br><br>
Paul ✌️
